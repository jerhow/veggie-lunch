# veggie-lunch

A Slack command integration to help manage the vegetarian lunch orders for our team.

Basically, this is a headless Clojure backend, whose frontend is Slack via the custom command `/veggie-lunch`

Right now I'm backing this app with SQLite, but it can easily be tweaked to work with MySQL, PostgreSQL, or any other relational database with a JDBC driver.

## Usage

Currently, in development I'm running it with this:

`lein run -m veggie-lunch.core`

In production, I'm building a .jar with Leiningen:

`lein uberjar`

...and deploying it on a lightweight VPS, behind a reverse proxy, over SSL.

Right now the app server is http-kit, but you should be able to drop in any other Ring-compliant server.

## Commands

The app is meant to be used like a command-line tool. As such, it currently supports 7 user commands and 9 additional admin commands:

`--about`

`--status` 

`--delete` 

`--help` 

`--list` 

`--menu`

`--order`

`--new-order` _(admin only)_

`--set-menu-url` _(admin only)_

`--lock` _(admin only)_

`--unlock` _(admin only)_

`--user-add` _(admin only)_

`--user-remove` _(admin only)_

`--user-list` _(admin only)_

`--user-perm` _(admin only)_

`--user-status` _(admin only)_
